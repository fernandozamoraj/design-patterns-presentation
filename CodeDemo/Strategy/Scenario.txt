You have been tasked to write a class that processes records from a flat file.  
The file is a comma separated file that contains each field separated by a comma.  
Each field contains the field's name along with it's value.
The file contains multiple types of records. 
The different types are personnel and equipment record.
The format for each of those types of records has been given to you therefore it is easy to identify each record type.
Before each field can be accepted into the database it must be rigrously validated.  
The validation rules are different for each record type.
In order to maintain cohesion in the responsiblities of classes the validation should be separated into different strategies even
though the all records will be processed by the same record processor.
Valid records will be pushed to the database.
Invalid records will be written to a log file.

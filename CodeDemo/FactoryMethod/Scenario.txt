You have been tasked to write some payroll functionality.  
You have different types of personnel.
Currently you have hourly exempt, hourly non-exempt and salaried exempt personnel.
Each of these different personnel have different set of rules in regards to how they get paid and how many
hours they can work without approval.
Currently those are the only known rules but there may be additional rules.
To avoid switch statements and convoluted logic it is recommended that you create classes for each
different type of employee.
